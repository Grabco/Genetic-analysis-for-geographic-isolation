Genetic analysis for geographic isolation comparison of brown bears living in different areas

## Summary

The brown bear is a wide-ranging species exhibiting malebiased dispersal. Adult males commonly use hundreds of square kilometres in their search for food and mating opportunities and dispersing subadult male brown bears may roam over areas up to 12,000 km2. Such movements facilitate gene flow and, in the case of dispersing young males, there is evidence that it operates as a mechanism to avoid inbreeding. Knowledge of population size, distribution, social and sexual structure, home range and population trend on the local level as well as migration is crucial for the proper conservation and management of species within and between protected areas. 


## Background

Division of Animals into Clusters
Processing of acquired data and in particular in finding answers to the question of individuals distribution on the
site led them to propose procedures for evaluation of microsatellite data will be processed using AI. 


## How is it used?

Biomonitoring
• Invasive - GPS tracking, traps
• Non-invasive - hair, blood on trees and so on (source of biological material for microsatellite analysis)

Seven microsatellite loci Mu26, Mu64, G10B, G1D, G10L, Mu50 and Mu51 were amplified using polymerase chain reaction and fragment length (allele) analyses were carried out on eight-capillary sequencer (Genome Lab GeXP, BeckmanCoulter). To test for individuals, seven microsatellite loci (UaMU26, UaMU64, G10B, G1D, G10L, UaMU50 and UaMU51) were amplified in a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR): a longer fragment of each locus was amplified prior to amplifying a more specific area. Two-step PCR procedures improve genotyping success rate and limit genotyping errors. Observed (HO) and expected (HE) heterozygosity were calculated using Cervus 3.0 software (Field Genetics). 

Results will be compared with genetic data from brown bears in core ranges of the central north and south Europe.

Method for non-invasive bear biomonitoring


## Data sources and AI methods
Amplified seven microsatellite loci Mu26, Mu64, G10B, G1D, G10L, Mu50 and Mu51
Two methods were used Neighbor-joining and UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) for construction of clusters graphic presentation based on microsatellites data processing.


## What next?

Population genetics - animal protection

• Validation and testing lineage for breeding animals (horses, dogs, cats ...)
• Diagnosis of genetic disorder
• Demonstration of a link between STR polymorphism and disease
• Criminology - Database of bear criminals ’DNA fingerprint’ - Matching of suspect DNA with bear CODIS (Combined DNA Index system)
